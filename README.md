# About Me
I am a product designer who _designs*_ product vision, strategy, human experiences, and interfaces. _Design*_ to me is everything â€“ it is a vision, it is a strategy, it is the delightful experiences, and it is pixel perfection. Data Visualization is another skill that I am currently learning and adding to my design toolkit!

# What I hope to learn
In my Data Visualization course at CMU, I'm eager to expand my skills and knowledge in this field beyond my existing foundation. I want to learn how to effectively transform complex datasets into compelling visual narratives that communicate insights clearly and persuasively. 
Specifically, I aim to master various data visualization tools and techniques, understand the principles of visual design, and explore the nuances of storytelling through data. I hope to gain proficiency in selecting the right visualization methods for different types of data and audiences while honing my ability to critically assess and improve existing visualizations. Ultimately, I aspire to be equipped with the expertise needed to harness the power of data visualization to drive informed decision-making and effectively convey information in a visually impactful way.
